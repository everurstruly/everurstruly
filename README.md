### 🎭 Ice Breakers
* **Would you rather...**
  * Refactor code all day or write documentation all day?
  * Have all your code documented but messy, or perfectly structured but without a single comment?
* **Question**: Introvert or Extrovert? :)

#### **<em>"Good code is like good humor; if you have to explain it, it’s not great."</em>**
